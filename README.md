Disentangling the influence of density-dependence, size-dependence and environmental factors on the population dynamics of small pelagic fish 

In this study, we developed an age-based life cycle model to investigate the relative influence of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on successive transition rates along the life cycle of small pelagic fish (SPF). We applied this framework to a system composed of two small pelagic species of the Bay of Biscay, the European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and sardine (Sardina pilchardus) that share habitats during their life cycle and are exploited by commercial fisheries in the Bay of Biscay.
